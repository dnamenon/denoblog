man i love frogs.

I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night balling
So far from my past misfortune
No sleepin', late nights no eatin'
Gun squeezing, I'm a real Artesian
Ramona, I was round that corner
Still down, I'm a Norf Norf soldier
G slide right down Sawyer
When we slide, you won't see mornin - Vince staples and Juicy J, Big fish
